## How It Works 🔧
### Add Nodes
1. Browse Available Nodes
 - In the right sidebar, you'll see all available node types (currently just Message nodes)

2. Click to Add
 - Simply click on any node type - it will automatically appear on the canvas at a random position
(No drag-and-drop required - we simplified this interaction!)

3. See It Appear
The new node will:

 - Have default text ("Text Message")

 - Show connection handles (⚫ on left and right)

 - Be ready to connect to other nodes

 ### Connect Nodes
 - Drag from a node's handle (right side) to another node's handle (left side)

 ### Edit Content
 - Click any node to edit its text in the settings panel

 ### Save Flow
 - Click "Save Changes" to validate and save your workflow

 ## Validation Rules ⚖️
 - ✅ All nodes must be connected (except one endpoint)

 - ❌ No empty message nodes allowed

 - 🔗 Source handles can only have one connection
